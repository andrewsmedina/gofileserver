# gofileserver
Simple RESTFUL API demo server written on Go (golang) user Aws S3, postgresql
Authorization and authentication with token
Api designed to upload, download files to your local server and then download 
to cloud servers, the first to be implemented was aws s3
Call authorization required, Upload, Download, register new user

* It implements the `Upload files` interface so it is compatible with the standard `http.ServeMux`.
* It Implements the Download files based on URL host


## Used libraries:
- https://github.com/lib/pq - Sql Database.
- https://gopkg.in/gcfg.v1 - Text-based configuration files with "name=value" pairs grouped into sections (gcfg files).
- https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/aws - Package sdk Aws Amazon
- https://github.com/gorilla/mux - Implements a request router and dispatcher for matching incoming requests

## Install

With a [correctly configured](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#Workspaces) Go toolchain:

```sh
go get -u github.com/lib/pq
go get -u gopkg.in/gcfg.v1
go get -u github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/aws
go get -u github.com/gorilla/mux
go get -u github.com/jeffotoni/gofileserver
```

Configuring the environment to run sdk amazon API
[`SDK Examples`] (https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/tree/master/example)

```
mkdir ~/.aws/
vim ~/.aws/config

[default]
region = us-east-1
output = 

vim ~/.aws/credentials

[default]
aws_access_key_id = AKIX1234567890
aws_secret_access_key = MY-SECRET-KEY
```

Creating postgresql database

```sh
createuser ukkobox -U postgres
psql -d template1 -U postgres
psql=> alter user ukkobox password 'pass123'
createdb ukkobox -U postgres -O ukkobox -E UTF-8 -T template0
psql ukkobox -U postgres -f tables/ukkobox.sql
```

Edit the configuration file

```sh
vim config/config.gcfg
```
